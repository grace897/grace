        <h4>28/10/2020</h4>
        
        <p>During the Covid 19 lockdown, I started Khan Academy while doing online school. At first it was really confusing, and there are still a few things which I'm not 100% sure about so I need to look back to remember again. In my opinion, the 'Intro to HTML' section was super easy and I literally flew through the tasks, but as I continued to do the tasks, there were many difficult things, like having to add links to your page. I still do not get it.</p>

        <h4>28/10/2020...still the same day</h4>
        <p>I learnt many things really easily through Khan Academy. I never thought I would be able to do things like this. I really enjoyed learning about changing the colours of texts and backgrounds, and ended up playing with it a lot. Although I'm still an amateur at this, and I have still a lot of things to learn about, I do kind of wish, in the very slightest bit, that one day I might make my own website. </p>
